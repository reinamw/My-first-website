     <h2>Journey to transition from Medical Lab Technologist To Software Engineer</h2>
          <p>Hi everyone! I am currently a medical laboratory technologist self-studying for coding. I am hoping to transition from the healthcare to the tech industry. Although there will be many challenges along the way, I am excited to learn coding! This website serves as my journey as I slowly learn and improve on programming skills. I am hoping to work as a software engineer and I am very excited to share my journey everyone!</p>

     <h2>My Goal</h2>
     <ol>
          <li>Have a basic understanding of what programming is about.</li>
          <li>Familiarize myself with HTML, CSS and JavaScrip.</li>
          <li>Look for programs that allows self-pace learning.</li>
          <li>Start the learning curriculum and hopefully complete one section a day</li>
          <li>Supplement learning materials from videos or websites that explains the concept.</li>
          <li>Hopefully practice everyday and build onto my current understanding.</li>
          <li>Start a presence on Github and post small projects on my repository.</li>
          <li>Repeatly practice and continue to build on small projects and gradually build on larger projects.</li>
          <li>Hope to self study for about a year or a year and a half</li>
          <li>At that time period, start preparing for interview questions and job application process.</li>
          <li>Hopefully, land on a software engineering job!</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>My Current Process</h2>
          <p>I am currently learning programming through App Academy Open. So far, I have learn basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also supplement my learning materials through Youtube videos to fill in the gaps and have a better understanding of the concepts. Through the course of this journey, I will be improving on this webpage as I become more proficient at programming. You will be able to see the transformation of page through my Github websitepage. I am looking forward to learning!  </p>
          <p> Current process:</p>
          <ul>
               <li>HTML</li>
